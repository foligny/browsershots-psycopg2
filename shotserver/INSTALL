= How to install the ShotServer =

'''This documentation is for the development version 0.4 of Browsershots 
(based on [http://www.djangoproject.com/ Django]).''' The documentation for 
the old stable version 0.3 is [InstallServerOld here].

If you want to support the development of Browsershots, you can hire me as 
a contractor to set up Browsershots as an in-house browser testing system 
for you, and adapt it to your requirements. I speak German and English (and 
a little French and Swedish), and will come to your office even if it's in 
Timbuktu. Send email to [mailto:johann@browsershots.org 
johann@browsershots.org] if you're interested. My rates are cheap because 
I'm still a student, so hurry!

== Hardware and OS ==

See RequirementsForServer.

----

== Software ==

=== Prerequisites ===

{{{
sudo apt-get install netpbm
}}}

=== Install Django source code ===

Until Django 1.0 is released, Browsershots 0.4 will use the development 
version (trunk) of Django.

{{{
svn checkout http://code.djangoproject.com/svn/django/trunk django
cd django
sudo python setup.py install
}}}

=== Install ShotServer source code ===

Use Subversion to check out the latest development version of the software 
(the same code that is running on http://v04.browsershots.org/):

{{{
svn checkout http://svn.browsershots.org/trunk/shotserver
}}}

For the quick-start development server, you don't need to install the 
Browsershots source code in '''/usr/lib/''' because you run the development 
server from your local copy. Only for use with a real web server like 
Apache, you would do the following:

{{{
cd shotserver
sudo python setup.py install
}}}

=== Install the database ===

You need a recent version of PostgreSQL. If version 8.2 is not available on 
your distribution, 8.1 will work too.
{{{
sudo apt-get install postgresql-8.2 python-psycopg
}}}

You can create the database as the same user that will be running the 
development server, so you don't need to worry about passwords.
{{{
createdb shotserver04
CREATE DATABASE
}}}

If necessary, create the database user first (replace www-data with your 
username):
{{{
sudo -u postgres createuser www-data
Shall the new role be a superuser? (y/n) n
Shall the new role be allowed to create databases? (y/n) y
Shall the new role be allowed to create more new roles? (y/n) n
CREATE ROLE
}}}

Let Django create the database tables for you:
{{{
cd shotserver/shotserver04
./manage.py syncdb
}}}

When it asks if you would like to create an admin account, say yes.

=== Create content folders ===

If you haven't changed the directories in '''settings.py''', you need the 
following folders:
{{{
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/v04.browsershots.org/png
}}}

The '''png''' folder must be writable by the user running the server.
{{{
sudo chown www-data:www-data /var/www/v04.browsershots.org/png
}}}

== Quick start with the development server ==

On a production system, you would use Apache 2 or some other serious web 
server. But to get started quickly, it is recommended that you use the 
Django development server first, and then switch to a real web server later 
when it works okay.

=== Run the development server ===

You can do this on your normal user account, but you must have write access 
to the database '''shotserver04''' and to the directory 
'''/var/www/browsershots.org/png/'''.

{{{
cd shotserver/shotserver04
./manage.py runserver
}}}

More detailed instructions are available in the 
[http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/django-admin/ Django 
documentation].

== Admin interface ==

Point your browser to http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/ and enter your username 
and password.

=== Adjust the sites configuration ===

 * Go to the "Sites" admin page http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/sites/site/
 * Change "example.com" to "127.0.0.1:8000" or equivalent
 * Change the display name to "Browsershots"

=== Create screenshot factories ===

http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/factories/factory/add/

== Web frontend ==

Point your browser to http://127.0.0.1:8000/ to see the web interface. 
Replace 127.0.0.1 with the hostname of your development machine if you want 
to access it from other computers.

=== Add browsers to your factories ===

Visit http://127.0.0.1:8000/browsers/add/ with each browser on your 
screenshot factory. The page should detect your browser settings 
automatically. Enter your password and click submit to register your 
browser in the database.

You can use http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin/browsers/browser/ to add or delete 
browsers manually or change their settings.

== Run Django with mod_python on Apache ==

After you get the development server to run, you may want to switch to a 
real web server for performance and stability. See the 
[http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/modpython/ Django 
documentation] for details, and INSTALL.APACHE for example configuration.
