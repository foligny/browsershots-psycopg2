Browsershots makes screenshots of your web design in different
browsers. It is a free open-source online service created by Johann C.
Rocholl. When you submit your web address, it will be added to the job
queue. A number of distributed computers will open your website in
their browser. Then they will make screenshots and upload them to the
central server.

This is the software for the central server.
See INSTALL for installation instructions.
